This is a simple web-based Todo List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, toggle, and delete tasks in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: You can add a new todo by entering a description in the input field and pressing Enter.

- **Toggle Completed**: Click on a todo item to mark it as completed. Click it again to mark it as incomplete.

- **Delete Todo**: Right-click on a todo item to delete it from the list.

- **Local Storage**: Your todo list is saved in your browser's local storage, so your tasks will persist even after you close or refresh the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the web page is defined in HTML.

- **CSS**: The styling of the page is done using CSS, which includes a font import from Google Fonts for the 'Poppins' font.

- **JavaScript**: The interactivity and functionality of the application are implemented using JavaScript.

## Project Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page. It includes the form for adding todos and the container for displaying the todos.

- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page, making it visually appealing.
